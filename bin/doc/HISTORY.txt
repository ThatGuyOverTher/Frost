Changes since version 2-Dec-2004 dev:

Added: if we have an old identities file, it is deleted after being converted to the new xml format.
Added: saving of both the uploads and downloads models is much more robust now.
Added: some internationalization improvements.

Changed: messages are signed by default.
Changed: now the size of the new message window is relative to the size of the main window.
Changed: now, when you are writing a new message and you want to attach a board to it, you can choose 
         among all the known boards, instead of among the ones you are subscribed to.

Bugfix: obsolete strings in the language resources were causing an exception when trying to open 
        the translation frame.

Changes since version 22-Nov-2004 dev:

Added:  messages can be deleted now.
Added:  now the dialogs that may pop up when Frost is started create a dummy frame so that the user can
        see on the task bar that there is activity going on.
Added:  in case Frost finds an error while auto saving a resource, a popup is shown to warn the user
        about the situation and the application closes itself.
Added:  popup menu to the message body of the new message frame (cut, copy and paste).
Added:  popup menus to all the JTextFields in the preferences (to perform the usual clipboard operations).

Changed: when an unsigned message is received with the @ character in the from field, it is automatically
         blocked.
Changed: skinlf updated to 1.2.10
         
Bugfix: some information was being saved duplicated on the identities.xml file.
Bugfix: with Java 1.5 Frost was failing to start from time to time (deadlock when showing the main frame).
Bugfix: Images that were created with Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().createImage and were not being checked 
        with a MediaTracker could cause problems. Now replaced by ImageIcon.

**************************************************************************************************

Changes since version 28-May-2004 dev:

Added:  a title to the "Enabled" column of the downloads table.
Added:  country flags to the language menu.
Added:  now the user can choose which columns the search, download and upload tables should show. That
        selection is made via a contextual menu that pops up when right clicking on the table header.
Added:  French translation vastly updated (thanks to RapHHfr).
Added:  Message upload failed dialog internationalized.
Added:  Option added to the preferences to disable the message upload failed dialog. If disabled, Frost 
        will retry to send it without asking the user.
Added:  attachment split panes of the main frame internationalized.
Added:  several French forums to the hierarchy that comes by default.
Added:  option to the popup menu of the message body to copy the selected text to the clipboard.

Changed: splash screen logo replaced by a new one (thanks to Frédéric Scheer).
Changed: when you are sending an anonymous message, the @ character is no longer allowed as part of the 
         from field.

Bugfix: when the text in the "Name" column of the uploads table is written in bold and it doesn't fit
        in the cell it isn't cropped correctly. Fixed now (it no longer uses HTML internally to display 
        it in bold).
Bugfix: The message upload failed dialog works now. Some strings were missing from the language resource.
        (thanks to SSY)
Bugfix: From Freenet 5099 on, keywords may be longer than 64 characters. Thanks to mxbee for reporting it.
Bugfix: The HopsToLive parameter must be in hexadecimal. Thanks to mxbee.
Bugfix: With Java 1.5, the attachment split panes of both the main and the message frames were not 
        working well.
