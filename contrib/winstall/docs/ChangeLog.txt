    * Changed the source tree
    * Added a make.bat script to make compilation easier
    * If install fails, files are now deleted (only if any previous version of
      Frost was not found)
    * Renamed versions.nsh to config.nsh (I think I will use this to store some
      configuration options later)
    * Added a Frost icon to the installer
    * 'downloads' and 'keypool' directories are now created at installation
    * Now deletes registry entries at uninstall
