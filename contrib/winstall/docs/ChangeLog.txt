    * Changed the classpath in shortcuts since Frost is now in a JAR file
    * 'keypool' and 'downloads' directories are not created anymore since Frost
      does it
    * Changed 'VERSION' to 'CONF_VERSION'
    * Added 'CONF_SIZE'
    * Updated Readme.txt
    * Changed Frost detection code
    * Added 'Last check : ' in the language files so translators just have to
      look at 'TranslationsTodo.txt'

    * Changed the source tree
    * Added a make.bat script to make compilation easier
    * If install fails, files are now deleted (only if any previous version of
      Frost was not found)
    * Renamed versions.nsh to config.nsh (I think I will use this to store some
      configuration options later)
    * Added a Frost icon to the installer
    * 'downloads' and 'keypool' directories are now created at installation
    * Now deletes registry entries at uninstall
