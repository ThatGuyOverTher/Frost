---  HOWTO - Build Frost  ---
  -------------------------

Prereqs:
---------

Apache ANT must be installed. Get it from http://ant.apache.org


Build the source retrieved from SVN:
-------------------------------------

If you got the Frost source code from the SVN repository, go to the
Frost source directory and run the command 'ant'. This starts the Frost
build. After the build finished, Frost is ready to run in the directory
build/dist.


Build the source retrieved from a Frost source.zip file:
---------------------------------------------------------

If you got the Frost source code from the frost-source.zip file, you need
to copy the complete lib/ directory from the binary Frost distribution zip
file into the Frost source directory. Then go to the Frost source directory
and run the command 'ant'. This starts the Frost build. After the build
finished, Frost is ready to run in the directory build/dist.
