---  HOWTO - Build Frost  ---
  -------------------------

Prereqs:
---------

Apache ANT must be installed. Get it from http://ant.apache.org


Build the source retrieved from SVN:
-------------------------------------

If you got the Frost source code from the SVN repository, go to the
Frost source directory and run the command 'ant'. This starts the Frost
build. After the build finished, Frost is ready to run in the directory
build/dist.


Build the source retrieved from a Frost source.zip file:
---------------------------------------------------------

If you got the Frost source code from the frost-source.zip file, you need
to copy the contents of the 'lib/' directory from the binary Frost distribution zip
file into the 'frost-wot/lib/' directory. Then go to the 'frost-wot' directory
and run the command 'ant'. This starts the Frost build. After the build
finished, Frost is ready to run in the directory build/dist.

Note: ant uses the environment variable JAVA_HOME to find the JDK.


Using ebuilds on gentoo linux:
-------------------------------

Tommy[D] provided the following information about how to use ebuilds on gentoo linux:

I created some ebuilds for freenet and frost, they are in the sunrise overlay.
So if someone wants to install freenet or frost in the future or wants to update frost,
he can use this ebuilds. For updates of freenet I still recommend freenet itself as it is
faster (update over sunrise overlay can have a delay of some days, depending on my time
and the time of the devs reviewing sunrise).

Short way to use them:

- emerge -av layman (if not already installed)
- layman -a sunrise (if not already added)
- emerge -av freenet / emerge -av frost

If you want to install freenet and frost, "emerge -av frost" should do the job as freenet
is a dependency of frost. Both ebuilds atm only have ~86 KEYWORD, an ebuild called freenet-bin
has binarys for ~86 and ~amd64.
If someone is interested in other KEYWORDS, wants to comment on those ebuilds or otherwise
wants to talk to me, i am active in frost and in #freenet, #freenet-de, #frost and #gentoo-sunrise
(server irc.freenode.net) as Tommy[D].
