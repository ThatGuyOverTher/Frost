* Implemented the ability to track which files have already been downloaded.
  By default this feature is off, you can activate it in the properties menu.
  When a new download was already downloaded, the user will be
  warned and asked if he wants to continue the download.

* When adding a new downloads from a post (keys or attachments) a dialog will
  be shown where the items can be attributed:
  - Download dir
  - Filename
  - Filename prefix
  - Priority

  This dialog also states if the file has already been downloaded
  (download tracking) or if a file with the same name already exists in the
  download target directory.

* Implemented tracking from which post / board a download was originated.
  Combined with a new setting (when enabled) the download directory will
  default to a subdirectory of the default download directory with the board name.
  If the target download directory does not already exist, it will be created.

=== Release 2 ================================================================

* Two additional buttons to show starred or flagged messages only.

* Uploading is fixed.

* Sorting by download directory sorts by complete path.

* Filename prefix can be changed for existing downloads.

* Directories can be created from the download pane.

  Simply type in a (non-existent) path and click the "Create directory"
  button.

  This will create all non-existent components of the path.
  I.e "/foo/bar/" will create both /foo and /foo/bar if neither exists.

* Keys can be added directly from the message window by highlighting the keys
  as if you were to copy them to the clipboard, right-clicking the anywhere
  in the message window to bring up the "copy/paste" menu, and selecting
  the new "Download keys to..." menu entry.

  You will be asked what folder to download the keys to. After you choose
  what folder it will give you an option to "Enter text to prefix filenames
  with, or leave empty for no prefix". If you wish to add a prefix so a
  filename would change from "01.rar" to "filename_01.rar" you can do so at
  that point.

  This works regardless of whether "show keys as hyperlinks" is enabled,
  although, if it is enabled, if you right-click on the linked keys you will
  instead bring up the regular Frost key download popup menu. So you can NOT
  click on the linked key to bring up this new menu, you have to click outside
  of the selected keys.

* Invalid "keys" that are entered into the quickload text field are silently
  ignored.

* The 20 most recently used download directories are remembered.

  They are accessed by right-clicking the download directory text field on
  the download pane ("Set to..."), and are available from the new
  "Download keys to..." menu entry in the message window.

* Restarting running downloads actually restarts the downloads.

  Frost normally does nothing when you tell it to restart a running download.
  There is (hackish) functionally to do that in the latest SVN version that
  was not being used, so I enabled it.

  There is a chance that downloads get lost if the connection to your Freenet
  node is very slow, or if Freenet is overloaded, but so far that has never
  happened to me.

  Note: When you restart a running download, it will briefly disappear, and
        then re-appear with all settings kept (download dir, assoc. message,
        priority, etc).

* Ability to execute a program on download/upload completion.

  Enabled through Options -> Preferences -> Downloads/Uploads ->
                  Execute program on completion.

  To disable, simply set "Execute program on completion" to nothing.

  Arguments passed to the download-completion program:
    1: Download filename (without path, prefixed)
    2: Filename prefix (empty if none)
    3: Download key
    4: Associated board name (empty if none)
    5: Associated message ID (empty if none)

    Also available as environment variables:
      FROST_FILENAME, FROST_FILENAME_PREFIX, FROST_KEY,
      FROST_ASSOC_BOARD_NAME and FROST_ASSOC_MSG_ID.

    The working directory is set to file's download directory.

  Arguments passed to the upload-completion program:
    1: Filename
    2: The CHK key

    Also available as environment variables:
       FROST_FILENAME and FROST_KEY.

    The working directory is set to file's directory.

* Option to disable checking for non-existent/changed uploading files

  If you're using an upload-completion program that moves uploaded files,
  this stops Frost from popping up an annoying message that tells you a
  file has been "moved" or has "changed size", and removing the file from
  the upload table.

  Options -> Preferences -> Uploads -> Periodically check for ...

* Collapsed thread mode changes:

  * "View associated message" now works

  * Option to expand threads with unread messages

  * Option to pre-expand all replies, but keep the root thread collapsed
    (When you open a collapsed thread, all messages are expanded by default)

  * Option to disable bringing up a message window when a message is
    double-clicked. (This is so you can double-click to expand messages)

    Options -> Preferences -> Messages -> Double clicking displays message

* A warning message is displayed if filesharing is enabled.


=== Release 1 ================================================================

* Quick paste download button
  Adds keys from the clipboard. Saves having to paste them into the text box
  and pressing enter.

* Prefix downloaded filenames with the text of your choice:
  1. Enter a prefix, such as "playtoy_sugar".
  2. Add your downloads.
  3. 1.rar is saved as playtoy_sugar_1.rar, etc.

  Once set, the prefix can't be changed, so don't make any typos.

  You can add a prefix to existing downloads by selecting them and pressing
  the update button.

* Per-download download directory.
  Select a download directory prior to adding downloads, either by clicking
  the browse button, or by typing the path manually (the text field turns red
  if the path is invalid), and your downloads will end up in that directory.

  You can change the download directory for existing downloads by selecting
  them and pressing the update button.

* Download are associated with the currently selected message
  When you add keys through the quickload interface, the downloads are
  associated with the currently selected news message.

  Simply right-click on a download and select "View associated message" to
  view the associated message.
  (This option is only shown if the download is associated with a message.)

  Should make it easier to ask for reinserts...

* "Blahwad's bot blaster"
  Hides messages from identities with fewer than X received messages.
  Configurable per board and globally. You can also choose to always show
  private messages.

* Messages are inserted twice (but not duplicated)
  Hopefully this reduces the number of messages that get lost.

* Compression for inserts is disabled
