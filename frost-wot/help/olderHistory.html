<H2>Older Frost History</H2>
<PRE>

2009.03.14:
------------

- added new preferences-option; board tree font can now be changed
- number of messages in the [Outbox] is displayed
- updated french translation (thanks to batosai)
- correct count of todays messages is displayed in board info dialog
- fixed bug within cleanup of file list, old owners were not deleted
- repaired file sharing in general, it failed when the node created
  new CHK keys for the same file
- new option to enforce Frosts priority setting. When the priority is
  externally changed then Frost resets it to its own value.
  See Options->Preferences->Downloads and Uploads.
  NOTE: The priority can only be enforced when Frost is running.
- new feature to hide selected files in file search table. Hidden
  files will never be shown again in a search, until you reset the
  hidden state under Options->Preferences->Search.
- board information window shows much more content and allows
  delete of boards
- fixed problems when using the Nimbus look&feel

2008.03.04:
------------

- more MacOS usability enhancements (e.g. backspace now deletes messages on all OS)
- security fix: sometimes the local path of a file attachment was exposed

2008.02.29:
------------

- when adding new shared files you can now choose how to handle files that are
  already shared (ignore new files or take over new file path)
- option to compact storages during startup (Options->misc.).
  Releases unused disk space and increases storage access performance
- option to delete file list files which have a CHK key, but no more owners
- updated HOWTO-BUILD.txt with gentoo Linux ebuild informations from Tommy[D]
- added updated russian translation (thanks to Alexey)
- new board update information dialog, shows statistics about the node requests
- new anti DoS feature: if enabled and the threshold of subsequent invalid
  messages is reached, the board update stops so the next board can be updated.
  When a DoS for today is detected, the board is shown in RED in the board tree
  and the board tooltip informs you about that.
- fix to prevent a current DoS attack to the shared file system
- fixed bug "When sending a message with file attachements and restarting Frost
  while the files is still uploading  I get an error when Frost is started up again."
- updated most icons (thanks to Alexey and also Kay)
- workaround for 'high cpu load when showing alot of animated smileys' problem,
  now smiley animations stop immediately when they are not longer shown
- 0.7: cleanup removes all obsolete AAEC encrypted files from the list
- 0.7: own shared files with an obsolete AAEC key are resetted
- 0.7: fixed bug, during "copy extented info" the filename was appended twice

2007.12.11:
------------

- fixed bug that some unread messages were not shown
  in threaded view when 'Show only unread messages' is enabled
- all data are now stored in perst storages instead of McKoi sql db
  - faster display of boards
  - messages with state NEW, FLAGGED or STARRED are now always shown
- re-requested downloads start automatically when download is still
  in FAILED state and the lastUploadedTime changed to a later value
- confirmation message for 'Mark all messages read' can be suppressed
- enhanced identities browser:
  - popup menu to copy the identity to the clipboard
  - popup menu to copy the identity and its public key to the clipboard
  - popup menu to export only selected identities to xml file
- received message count per identity is now maintained. Initial values are set during
  migration from McKoi from the current amount of messages in keypool and in archive.
- received message count is shown in 'Manage identities' dialog and in the new
  tooltip for the 'From' column in the message table
- request shared files when its runtime without progress exceeds 12 hours
- archiving works again (was broken in earlier alpha version)
- added 'Search' option to popup menu in board tree (boards or folders)
- removed skin support (caused several problems in GUI)
- added setting 'Don't show own messages as ME' (Options->Display->Messages)
- added setting to show the menu bar on the screen when running on MacOs
- trust state for sharer identities can be changed in shared file details dialog
- added automatic backup of local identities (can be disabled in options 'Miscellaneous')

- improved validation of incoming messages, shorter log output
- option to disable saving of sent messages (overrideable per board)
- added a smiley chooser
- added 'Send message' to board tree popup menu, allows to send a message
  without to select the board
- added indication for identities with low received message count
  (configurable in options, Display->Messages)
  (if you don't like the indicator icons, please send me some nicer ones!)
- adjusted file sharing parameters
- messages can be set as JUNK now (new column in message list)
- multiple selected messages can be set to flagged/starred/junk
- new keyboard shortcuts: "s" = toggle starred, "f" = toggle flagged, "j" = toggle JUNK
- the identity of the message marked as JUNK can be set to BAD (option)
- JUNK and BAD messages are not archived but discarded
- added '.7z' as file extension for archives
- infos from board information dialog can be copied to clipboard
- layout of search files table is saved
- 0.5: downloading did not work with non-splitfile files whose expected filesize was unknown
- 0.5: fixed "java.io.IOException: Attempt to use a released RandomAccessFileBucket".
       Due to this exception the decode after download failed, but worked after
       next Frost startup.
- 0.5: fix for file requests, FAILED downloads are not disabled and requests
  should be send now for those files. The FAILED state is retained after a Frost
  restart.
- 0.7: added checking for boards that use an obsolete encryption key
- 0.7: default priorities for upload/download of messages/files can be set
       in the options
- 0.7: 'Use single connection for message transfers' option in options dialog

2007.07.19:
------------

- length of file list download queue is shown in status bar ("FLQ").
  This is the number of file lists that wait to get downloaded.
  When all items were downloaded, the file base is most current
  and the file search finds the latest files.
- fixed bug 1749043: Table layout corrupted after 'Mark thread read'
- new options to hide files from users marked CHECK or OBSERVE,
  the options are now accessible directly in the search files panel
  ('Options...' button).
- new option 'Never expire flagged and starred messages', prevents
  expiration of any flagged/starred messages, and  shows them in the
  message table even if they are older then the configured days to
  display
- Windows: 'Always minimize to systray' now remembers if the window
           was maximized before user clicked the minimize icon.
- 0.7: all KSK requests are now handled by one connection to the node
       ("fcp2.useOneConnectionForMessages" in frost.ini)
- 0.7: disabling a running upload or download item now changes its
       priority to 6 (pause), enabling an item changes its priority
       to the default priority for files
- 0.7: added menu item 'Remove item from global queue' to uploads
       and downloads table popup menu

2007.07.02:
------------

- 'minimize to systray' button fixed
- new option to automatically minimize Frost to tray when the
  window is minimized (systray icon must be enabled)
- respect archive interval days (don't run archiving each startup)
- downloads/uploads are now started in the same order as
  they were added
- fixed ugly bug: backward messages were downloaded again and again
- new popup menu entry for uploads and downloads table:
  'Start selected Uploads/downloads immediately'. Overrules the 
  configured maximum count of running uploads/downloads.
- the filename tooltip in upload table or download table shows
  the time when the item was added/started/finished
  (only shown when informations are set)
- 0.5: during startup old upload file chunks are removed from
       localdata directory (.checkblocks/.redirect files).
       ("removeOldUploadFileChunks" in frost.ini)
- 0.7: fixed problem that Frost was not able to download
       keys with a filename that ends to .zip. The node
       tries to do fancy things in this case and the download
       fails even if the file is there. Frost now recognizes
       this case and restarts the download using a key without
       any path level.
- 0.7: the target filename of a PUT is now set when you
       add a file manually to the uploads. This prevents
       problems when downloading the file with applications
       that have no special circumvention handling like Frost.
       ("fcp2.setTargetfilenameForManualPut" in frost.ini)

2007.06.28:
------------

- greatly enhanced startup speed for 'Manage identities' dialog,
  thanks to database-man
- removed import from old Frost versions (previous version must
  be at least 23-Dec-2006)
- migrated various internal tables from McKoi SQL database to
  perst object database, much faster, lesser usage of disk space
  and memory (messages are still in in McKoi database)
- archiving and cleanup of McKoi tables now only all 5 days
- fixed message download bug, it happened that Frost stopped to
  download message indices of a board too early
- fixed another message download bug, not all days backwards
  were correctly downloaded
- Frost now receives only messages from Frost version 20-Jun-2006
  or later (the message must have a valid unique message id!)
      
2007.04.19:
------------

FIXED BUGS:

- 0.7: one file sharing download had no MaxSize set
- 0.7: fixed latest cross-board message re-posting attack, now more
  fields are contained in the digital signature. This is backward
  compatible, old Frosts can read messages from new Frosts, and new Frosts
  show messages from old Frosts with an italic "Sig" string. You can disable
  to receive messages with the old signature in the options.

2007.04.13:
------------

FIXED BUGS:

- close of a searchtab cancels a running search
- modal dialogs will not be hidden in the background
- redesigned several database transactions to avoid database
  corruption in case of a crash
- after drag'n drop or delete of a board the root node is not any
  longer selected each time
- message subject tooltip bug fixed
- message viewer scrolls not to idline bug fixed
- delete key deletes message, also when selection is in preview pane
- Windows platform: restore from systray shows Frost window topmost
- fixed 'n' key bug
- fixed 'threads shown during message load' bug
- GUI fixes (button layout in metal look and feel)
- finally fixed bug that showed new messages for a board,
  but when you clicked on the board there was no new message
- fixed a 'hang' when more than the maximum allowed files
  were found in the file search
- fixed archiving of messages with duplicate ids
- fixed NPE in table formats (happened very seldom)
- added 'Mark selected messages read' for multiple selected
  messages
- added set of trust states for multiple selected messages
- balanced the file sharing/file requesting logic

NEW FEATURES:

- implemented sent/unsent folders in board tree
- if node is down during startup, automatic board update is not
  disabled (not really a new feature but a change), but the title
  bar displays "(offline mode)"
- redesigned options dialog (splitted the display panel)
- new option to prevent reordering of boards in board tree
- new option: board in board tree show indicators if board
  contains flagged or starred messages
- new option to show message threads collapsed (default is expanded)
- if the root message of a thread is missing, it shows the subject
  of a child message
- during startup of Frost, if multiple shared files are missing,
  Frost showed one dialog for each missing file. Now you can choose
  to skip further dialogs of same type
- sent private messages are now shown in the message list (I hope
  there are no bad side effects caused by this enhancement)
- added a button to show only unread messages (flat view) or only
  the threads with unread messages (threaded view)
- file search performance was improved when searching for any words
  (its currently faster to search for 'mp3' than to select 'Audio files')
- restructured and cleanup up the options dialog
- added 'look and feel' menu to options menu
- added swedish translation
- added subject text to message preview pane, popup menu
  allows to copy subject text
- added incremental search feature to message preview and viewer.
  click in the text area and press ctrl-i to start case-insensitive
  search or ctrl-shift-i for case-sensitive search. While searching
  press up/down key to select next/previous match in text. Press ESC
  to end the search.
- incremental search also works in download table, upload table,
  shared files table, search table and in message tree/list.
  The selected column is searched.
- incremental search also works in board tree
- Look and feel is correctly saved
- Look and feel is applied to all panels
- Look and feel does not reset when closing the options dialog
- Copy extented info to clipboard copies correct key/filename
- 'Copy keys only' for attached files works now on 0.5;
  and is not longer shown on 0.7
- 'Copy keys ...' for attached files does not longer attach a
  newline when only 1 key is copied
- added menu items to enable/disable upload items to popup menu
- added esperanto translation
- download/upload starts smallest items first and continues
  started items correctly on 0.5

- Windows platform: the systray icon indicates new messages

- 0.7: Frost now uses the global queue for file uploads and downloads
- 0.7: no DDA for message transfers (as recommended by toad)
- 0.7: more robust code to handle disappeared nodes, Frost shows
       when node is disconnected and reconnects automatically
- 0.7: added config file options to set default priority for files and
       messages, useful when using the HARD scheduler.
       "fcp2.defaultPriorityMessage" and "fcp2.defaultP

2007.01.07:
------------

FIXED BUGS:

- font is correctly applied in message list, and its applied after it was changed in
  the option dialog
- fixed sorting of 'Enabled' columns in upload and download table
- fixed several problems in translation plugin
- restructured database access code, greatly reduces load and memory footprint.
  also fixes the lost shared files issue.
- fixed problem with new identity handling, new identities with same pubkey
  as already known identities are now dropped (together with the message).
  (the FAKE message state is not any longer used for new messages, all invalid
   messages are dropped and a log entry is written)
- 0.5: fixed a memory leak in splitfile insertion

NEW FEATURES:

- message state FAKE is now drawn in red color
- added a button to advanced search panel to clear all text fields
- added polish translation
- 0.7: now showing appr. filesize for downloads, computed from the total finalized blocks
- 0.7: MIME type is now set for manual uploads and attachment uploads
- 0.7: MaxSize is used for message and filelist downloads

2006.12.23:
------------

There are too much changes in Frost to mention them all. Check out the various menus
and popup menus for table items. Many table cells (e.g. with icons) have self-describing
tooltips.

Some of the new features:
- multiple identities
- last used sender is remembered for each board separately
- completely new filesharing; now global (search based on keywords), not board based
- message threads
- a database is used for all data
- select the root node in board tree to see sent and unsent messages

2006.06.20:
------------

Added: Download panel input field now accepts keys separated by semicolon OR
       one key per line (this is new).
Added: Sum of remaining file attachments to upload for all uploading messages is now
       shown in status bar (the A value in TOFUP).
Added: Initial work for threaded messages, messages not get a unqiue anonymous ID and
       maintain a InReplyTo list. Thjis will allow to implement a thread view later,
       because the existing messages already have the needed informations.

Changed: After alot of work the translateable strings in Frost have been structured and
         were moved into a properties file. This file must be in UTF-8 encoding.
         A translation dialog is available in Plugins menu. The translations are saved
         in folder localdata/i18n/ and are available as external languages in
         the language menu.

Bugfix: The first startup dialog now allows to enter an IP address and port for the
        freenet node.
Bugfix: If signing of uploaded files is disabled, the owner of any file in the shared
        files of a board got lost.

2006.04.21:
------------

Added: Column position and column width of message table is now saved during shutdown.
Added: Added a graphical memory monitor ('Help' menu).
Added: Alternate editor support now works again. You can write a message with any
       program you want. Please take care that the external program must save the
       file in UTF-8 format to preserve your character encoding.
Added: Russian translation, thanks to VolodyA.
Added: Search dialog to search for messages in keypool and archive ('News' menu).
       This was a hard piece of work, but finally its there.
Added: 'Copy keys' in popup menu of file attachments table. Table now also shows the key.
Added: 'Add to known boards' in popup menu of board attachment table.
Added: Options to block boards from unsigned, bad, check or observe users.
       If blocked the boards in a message are not added to the known boards list.
Added: Mouse wheel support for scrollable components.
Added: Board tree now shows board description as tooltip (configureable in options).
Added: Multiline selections in message table. If more than one message is selected,
       you can (only) delete/undelete the selected messages. Configureable in options.
Added: HTML help browser to show the help pages in the /frost/help/help.zip file.
       You can search in HTML pages and there is a context menu to copy selected text
       to the clipboard. Check it out!
Added: Own Java security manager. Frosts security manager only allows Frost to open
       TCP/IP connections to the configured FCP hosts. All other connections attempts
       will not be allowed. This makes external links within the HTML help pages
       impossible, providing you maximum anonymity. Additionally the HTML pages in
       help.zip are scanned for external URLs during startup, if any external link
       is found the whole help will be disabled (help menu items are not chooseable).
Added: External conversion tool to convert all XML files in keypool and archive from
       encoding UTF-16 into encoding UTF-8. Frost must not run if the tool is started.
       Use the convertXML.bat or convertXML.sh startup script to invoke the tool.
       Please note that you must not run the tool to continue to use Frost, but it may
       help to save you some space on your hard drive. After the conversion its job is
       done, all files created by Frost are now in UTF-8 encoding by default.
Added: Implemented Freenet 0.7 support into official Frost. Frost can now run with
       Freenet 0.5 and 0.7, but not at the same time because the key formats are
       different. You need to run one Frost instance for each Freenet network.

Changed: Nicer board attachment chooser, contains checkboxes now.
Changed: All XML files are now saved in UTF-8 encoding, saves space.
Changed: Message window enhanced, shows attachments and more informations, allows reply.
Changed: Duplicate message prevention reenabled, and created an option for it.
Changed: Improved log file outputs, e.g. the for message upload log entries the freenet
         key is now shown.

Bugfix: Fixes in checkbox handling of MessageFrame.
Bugfix: Fixes in message download handling.
Bugfix: Splitfile download sometimes hung with state 100% for a long time.
Bugfix: After download the target file was sometimes not renamed to the correct filename.
Bugfix: File extension search is now case insensitiv (*.txt finds *.TXT now).

******************************************************************************************

2006.02.16:
------------

Added: Added an early version of a 'sent' folder. It is NOT visible in the
       GUI right now (needs bigger changes in folder management), but all
       sent messages (encrypted messages too) are now stored into a folder
       in the Frost directory (localdata/sent/) after a successful upload.
       You can open the sent messages in this folder using e.g. your internet
       browser. The 'sent' folder is included in the archiving process.
Added: added browse button for archive folder in expiration options

Changed: Disabled the duplicate message prevention mechanism (hashes.xml).
         Maybe it is not any longer needed, if users report many duplicate
         message I will enable it again.
Changed: Disabled translation feature, I wanted to fix it and recognized that
         it did never work correctly. If you want to translate Frost contact me.

Bugfix: Added fixes to (hopefully) prevent lost messages now. After ages of
        analysing I think the problem is the (now working) probabilistic caching
        in freenet node that does not always add the inserted message to your
        own store. This leads to situations where another message is inserted
        to the same message index by Frost and no key collision occured.
        Frost now retrieves the successfully uploaded file immediately after
        the upload to ensure it is in your store. If this fails the upload
        is retried.
Bugfix: Fixed some problems that happened if the count of days to download
        backwards was set to zero (e.g. no file index download started).
Bugfix: Fixed problem that currently shown message scrolled to bottom when a
        new message in same board arrives. New message indication
        (yellow icon) was also reset in this case, fixed too.
Bugfix: Fixed problem that occured if an unsent message is resend on Frost
        startup that contains file attachments and the files where deleted you
        got an annoying dialog telling you that the resend failed. Now the
        message is deleted (because its not valid without the attachment files).
Bugfix: It happened that new messages were indicated for a FOLDER, fixed (thanks mildew).

******************************************************************************************

2005.10.20:
------------

Added: message archiving feature (move expired msgs from keypool to archive folder)

Changed: made uploads more reliable (increased socket timeout)
Changed: improved keypool cleanup

Bugfix: fixed the splitfile upload at last, it was broken and works now

******************************************************************************************

2005.10.11:
------------
(important bugfix release, fixes many internal issues)

Changed: 'Next unread' button (or key 'n') now jumps to next unread message BY DATE
Changed: Frost now uses lesser threads and lesser memory (reduces system load)

Bugfix: restricted size of keyfile to upload (prevents 'KSK key too large' messages)
Bugfix: reworked MessageHashes to prevent init errors, restricted list size
Bugfix: several bugfixes in UpdateId area
Bugfix: problems with minimize to system tray solved, Frost now shows the current
        identity in title

******************************************************************************************

2005.09.18:
------------

Added: timestamp to hashes.xml; and implemented automatic cleanup of old entries
Added: Reworked the feature to send encrypted messages. The encrypted message must be
       signed, anonymous encrypted messages are not possible.
       If an encrypted message for you arrives, it appears in the board it was sent to
       and the FROM text is drawn in RED. The sender will not see its own sent message
       (because he is not able to decrypt it).
       If you want to write an encrypted message to someone you must have marked him GOOD.
       Then start to write a new message in a board, select 'Sign' and 'Encrypt' in
       the message dialog and choose the correct receiver from the drop down list.
       Then send the message as usual...
       (If you press REPLY to a selected encrypted message, the message dialog will
        automatically select 'Encrypt' and add the correct recipient.)
       The reworked encryption now uses AES to encrypt the data and RSA to encrypt the
       AES session key.

    NOTE TO ENCRYPTED MESSAGES:
       Currently the encrypted messages are send to a board, the recipient must be
       subscribed to this board. The message is encrypted with the public key of the
       recipient, only he is able to decrypt the message. Additionally the encrypted
       message is signed by the sender.
       The sending to a board WILL be changed in the future! Later Frost versions will be
       able to receive both types of private messages (to common boards and to a private
       board).
       I think the easiest way to implement private boards is as follows:
       Currently every identity has a unique name, which is NAME@DIGEST-OF-KEY.
       For private boards of a user we could use following KSK key:
       KSK@DIGEST-OF-KEY/NAME/file
       This way we don't have to create new keys. But you can't send a private message to
       a user if you have only his unique name, because Frost additionally needs the
       complete public key of the user to encrypt the message for him.
       Later we could implement to allow to send/receive messages like pm4pigs to
       maybe make Frost compatible to pm4pigs...

Added: generating and spreading of private board SSK key
Added: 'Mark ALL messages read' to boards and folders in boards tree
Added: 'Add board to folder ...' added to popup menu of board attachments and in known
       boards dialog
Added: signature is not appended for anonymous  (unsigned) messages
Added: Board settings can be changed for ALL boards in a folder
       (including in all sub folders).
       Right click onto a folder and choose 'Change settings', then select all that you
       want to change for all boards. Unselected settings are unchanged in each board.
Added: Option to enable/disable the automatic board updates is now available in
       Preferences dialog - News(3) too.
       Previously this setting was only changeable in menu News.
Added: Copy to clipboard functionality is now available in search table too.
Added: You can paste multiple keys into the download text box, separated by a ';'
Added: New user trust state OBSERVE, which is between CHECK and GOOD.
       For users that you trust not fully. The old N/A state was obsolete and was removed.
Added: lastSeenTimestamp for each Identity.
       Needed later to cleanup old Identities by user request.
Added: Shortkeys in message table:
       - press 'n' to jump to next UNREAD message in current board
       - press 'g' to mark sender of selected message GOOD
       - press 'o' to mark sender of selected message OBSERVE
       - press 'c' to mark sender of selected message CHECK
       - press 'b' to mark sender of selected message BAD
       (thanks to mentalsurge for this code!)
Added: Button to jump to next unread message.
Added: Possibility to filter by board name in known boards dialog.

Changed: Removed support for loading the very old format of 'hashes' and 'identities'
         because all Frost versions should support the XML format now.
         Up to the version 30-Aug-2005 the old format was silently converted by Frost
         to the new XML format.
Changed: removed need for .sig files, changing trust state is now very fast,
         there is a one-time convert needed for this (done on startup of frost)
Changed: Updated history.txt file, so the Help dialog will show correct history again.
Changed: upgraded from Apache Xerces XML parser version 2.4.0 to latest version 2.7.1
Changed: upgraded the BouncyCastle encryption libraries to latest version 1.29
Changed: the Java Object Cache is currently not used. It was responsible for serious
         problems if messages are marked read, and I was not able to realize what its
         benefits for Frost are. We even could use Hashtables for this.
Changed: reworked message table internals, the table now updates much faster.
Changed: Changing trust state does not reload the table.
Changed: Option "Cleanup keypool" (News(3)) removed, added 2 new options in News(1):
         "Delete expired messages" and "Number of days before a message expires".
         If "Delete expired messages" is selected, Frost will check all files in
         keypool (messages) on each startup for modification date and will delete files
         older than "Number of days before a message expires".
         Then all empty date directories in a board directory are deleted.
         The deletion of expired files is also done all 6 hours after Frost startup,
         directories are not deleted during runtime of Frost.
Changed: Size of messages to upload is now proved, you get an error dialog if the zipped
         message is too large and you have to shorten the message text.
         The data + metadata of a KSK key must be smaller than 32K, therefore a zipped
         XML message must be smaller or equal than 30000 bytes. The remaining bytes are
         needed for the metadata Frost adds to the message.
Changed: Files that switch to 'offline' state keep their CHK key. This means that if
         this offline file is downloaded, the download is tried and only if the
         download failed the file is requested (when requesting is enabled).

Bugfix: fixes in MessageDownloadThread:
        - validates format of all messages again
        - writes indicator files for received invalid/double/broken messages
        - under some circumstandes it was possible that message download stopped
          before all indicies were tried to download
Bugfix: Date of a message is set to current date when message is uploaded.
        Needed because we check on message arrival if message date is (quite) the same as
        date in the url that was used to retrieve the message.
        Prevents Frost from receiving a new message with a date in the future/past.
Bugfix: own identity state cannot be changed from GOOD any longer
Bugfix: identites file was not valid because of bugs in Truster and BuddyList,
        fixed all these bugs
Bugfix: because of the bugs the identities file is maybe not completely valid,
        added one-time repair for this, its silently done during Frost startup.
Bugfix: fixed some issues with new messages (new message indicator not removed
        after message was deleted,...)
... and many other minor fixes ...

2005.08.30
-----------
Bugfix: problem computing the first empty index for message uploads was fixed (IMPORTANT)
Bugfix: some GUI fixes

******************************************************************************************

2005.03.02
-----------
Added: if we have an old identities file, it is deleted after being converted to the new
       xml format.
Added: saving of both the uploads and downloads models is much more robust now.
Added: some internationalization improvements.
Added: the messages about downloading and uploading files at the status bar are clearer
Added: more details to the About dialog.
Added: option to see again those messages that have been deleted (they appear crossed)
Added: messagepopup menu option to undelete deleted messages
Added: del key deletes selected message
Added: new message window by double click on a message, ESC closes it
Added: details to the dialog that pops up when there is an error while automatically

         Now they support multiple selections and have an additional option
         (copy extended info).
Changed: now the message hashes are stored in XML format (instead of serialized).
         This will prevent problems when migrating to a new version of Java.

Bugfix: obsolete strings in the language resources were causing an exception when trying
        to open the translation frame.
Bugfix: message hashes are now thread safe, thus preventing a possible
        ConcurrentModificationException while saving them.
Bugfix: validation of received buckets added. This should solve the problem of corrupted
        downloads.

******************************************************************************************

2004.12.02
-----------
Added:  messages can be deleted now.
Added:  now the dialogs that may pop up when Frost is started create a dummy frame so that
        the user can see on the task bar that there is activity going on.
Added:  in case Frost finds an error while auto saving a resource, a popup is shown to
        warn the user about the situation and the application closes itself.
Added:  popup menu to the message body of the new message frame (cut, copy and paste).
Added:  popup menus to all the JTextFields in the preferences (to perform the usual
        clipboard operations).

Bugfix: some information was being saved duplicated on the identities.xml file.
Bugfix: with Java 1.5 Frost was failing to start from time to time (deadlock when showing
        the main frame).
Bugfix: Images that were created with Toolkit.getDefaultToolkit().createImage and were
        not being checked with a MediaTracker could cause problems. Now replaced by
        ImageIcon.

******************************************************************************************

2005.09.22
-----------
Added:  a title to the "Enabled" column of the downloads table.

Changed: when you are sending an anonymous message, the @ character is no longer allowed
         as part of the from field.

Bugfix: when the text in the "Name" column of the uploads table is written in bold and it
        doesn't fit in the cell it isn't cropped correctly. Fixed now (it no longer uses
        HTML internally to display it in bold).
Bugfix: The message upload failed dialog works now. Some strings were missing from the
        language resource (thanks to SSY).
Bugfix: From Freenet 5099 on, keywords may be longer than 64 characters.
        Thanks to mxbee for reporting it.
Bugfix: The HopsToLive parameter must be in hexadecimal. Thanks to mxbee.
Bugfix: With Java 1.5, the attachment split panes of both the main and the message frames
        were not working well.
