<H2>FROST additional FAQ</H2>

<P>This FAQ is a compilation of some of the questions and answers, that come again and again on the boards every week.  Thanks to all of the Frost community members who contributed to this FAQ.</P>

<P><B>Q: Where can I find more boards?</B></P>
<P>A: You need to explore Frost a bit.  See that globe at the top?  Click on it.  Now you see the boards.  Find the boards you like and select them, or select all, then right click on the selection and choose add board.  It's best if you build folders first and add the boards to the folders so they are organized.  If you want more boards follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Go to Options > Preferences > News (1)</LI>
<LI>Set the days to download backward to 60 and the days to display to 70.</LI>
<LI>Enable the News > Automatic Board Update.</LI>
<LI>Right click on the Boards board and select Refresh Board.</LI>
<LI>Give it some time and it will start to find messages that have boards and files attached.</LI>
<LI>After you've caught up on the boards/messages/files, set the options back to a more reasonable level.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Q: How do I download stuff?</B></P>
<P>A:</P>
<UL>
<LI>You can use Frost.  Copy the key CHK@ or SSK@, select the downloads tab, and and paste it in field and press Enter.</LI>
<LI>You can use the main page 127.0.0.1:8888.  Select Advance in the upper right, paste the key into the Request URI field, and click on the Request button.</LI>
<LI>You can use FUQID 127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@CKesZYUJWn2GMvoif1R4SDbujIgPAgM/fuqid/12//FUQID-1.5.zip</LI>
</UL>
<P>Or try the beta version at SSK@CKesZYUJWn2GMvoif1R4SDbujIgPAgM/fuqidbeta/5//FUQID-1.5.17.zip</P>

<P><B>Q: How do I upload stuff?</B></P>
<P>A: There are several different ways to upload content to Freenet.  Frost is OK for uploading small files and has a nice indexing function, but Fuqid is better suited for the task of uploading and downloading large files.</P>
<P>To upload via Frost:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Enable the Uploads option</LI>
<LI>Select the Uploads tab</LI>
<LI>Select the board you want the upload to be sent to</LI>
<LI>Click on the folder Icon at the top of the page</LI>
<LI>Select the files or folders you want to upload and click Open (don't select folders with personal information)</LI>
<LI>The file will populate the Upload page</LI>
<LI>Select the files and right click, and select Start Encoding</LI>
<LI>After the files have been encoded, right click on the files and select Upload</LI>
</OL>
<P>Caution: Once you've uploaded something to Freenet, there is no way to remove it.  The best you can hope for is that no one downloads it.</P>


<P><B>Q: how do I access that freesite?</B></P>
<P>A: You can get to it by putting it in your web browser like so: 127.0.0.1:8888/SSK@rjYFfgPHfolmcStiaoxESFfBXz8PAgM/FreenetHelp//</P>
<P>Or:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Copy the "SSK@..." from a frost message</LI>
<LI>Rightclick on freenet in the system tray and choose "open gateway"</LI>
<LI>In the upper right of the opening page, choose "switch to advanced mode"</LI>
<LI>Paste the SSK-Key at "Request freesite by URI"</LI>
<LI>Hit "Request"</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Q: How do i Create a new identity?</B></P>
<P>A:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Stop Frost</LI>
<LI>Rename or delete the identities.xml file in the frost directory</LI>
<LI>Restart Frost</LI>
<LI>Frost will ask you for a new nick name</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Q: How do I undelete a message?</B></P>
A: 1) Go to Option > Preferences > News (3) > Show Deleted Messages.</LI>
   2) Right click on the deleted message (the one with the line through it) and select Undelete.</LI>


<P><B>Q: How do I send private messages in Frost?</B></P>
<P>A:</P>
<OL>
<LI>You first have to mark the person you want to send a message to as GOOD.</LI>
<LI>Select the board you want to post the message on.</LI>
<LI>Select the Icon to create a message, or select reply to a current message.</LI>
<LI>Check the Encrypt For box and select their ID from the drop-down box.</LI>
<LI>Write the message and send it.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Q: Is there a way to send a message directly to someone over freenet other than Frost?</B></P>
<P>A: Try pm4pigs SSK@htiB09RddHraopVcK05SaHBP5hIPAgM,~EXPz06BymillNMGxoJf9w/1//pm4pigs-1.6a.rar</P>

<P><B>Q: Why do the same board names appear twice in the Known Boards List? They have different icons (a set of keys, a lock, etc.) I can't seem to add two with the same name, so which should I choose?</B></P>
<P>A: Frost can have duplicate boards (opened, keyed, and locked).  You can add two with the same name, but it will ask you if you want to over write the board.  Most people are moving to the open boards since giving everyone the keys to a locked board doesn't make sense.  Many of the keyed boards you see were created when Frost had that as the default board type.  Locked board are normally for announcement only.</P>

<P><B>Q: What's the big deal about signing FROST posts? Where's the value to me? Creating a signed NIC that can potentially be traced back to a specific computer seems to go against the freenet ideal of total anonymity. Obviously, I am missing something key - what is it?</B></P>
<P>A: The early Frost didn't have real signatures, so messages were faked, and you couldn't tell who really wrote the post.  Frost signatures were developed so people could carry on a real conversation.  If everyone posted as anonymous, things would get confusing.  You can change your identity, and have multiple identities if you choose.</P>

<P><B>Q: Can I have multiple identities?</B></P>
<P>A: Yes, but you can't change them on-the-fly.  To make multiple identities:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Stop Frost</LI>
<LI>Rename your identities.xml file to identities.xml.what-ever-your-identity-is</LI>
<LI>Start Frost.  It will ask you to create an identity.</LI>
<LI>Copy the new identities.xml file to identities.xml.your-new-identity</LI>
<LI>Now you can swap between the identities by stopping Frost and overwriting the identities.xml file with the persona you want to be.</LI>
</OL>
<P>Caution: The From field may show your previous identity.  To correct that, uncheck the Sign box, and then set it back.</P>

<P><B>Q: Will Freenet always be slow?</B></P>
<P>A: It will be slower than the normal internet due to the nature of the routing, but it does get better after time.  Your node needs to become acclimated.  Patience is the key.</P>

<P><B>Q: Can I change the look of Frost?</B></P>
<P>A: Yes, click Options > Preferences > Displays, and select Enable Skins.  More skins can be found here: javootoo.l2fprod.com/plaf/skinlf/index.php</P>

<P><B>Q: I downloaded some files in Frost, but all I see are *.data and *.checkblock files.  Where did the downloaded file go?</B></P>
<P>A: When Frost says it has downloaded a file at 100%, that means it has fetched enough data blocks + check blocks to generate the complete file from this, but hasn't finished the FEC-decoding yet.  Just be a bit more patient and you will eventually see the status changing to "Done".
The *.data, *.checkblocks and *.redirect files are temporary files, used by Frost. Don't delete them! Frost will take care of that, but sometimes only after a restart.</P>


<P><B>Q: Where can I find files to download?  When I search for files I don't see anything.</B></P>
<P>A: Files will show up in the search tab as your node becomes aware of them.  If you want to find more files, follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>Go to Options > Preferences > News (1)</LI>
<LI>Set the days to download backward to 30 and the days to display to 40.</LI>
<LI>Right click on a board where you might find files that you are interested in, and select Refresh Board.</LI>
<LI>Give it some time and it will start to find indexes.</LI>
<LI>After you've caught up on the files, set the options back to a more reasonable level.</LI>
<LI>Also, enable the News > Automatic Board Update.</LI>
</OL>

<P><B>Q: Anything else?</B></P>
<P>A: Yes. Visit www.freenethelp.org, and jtcfrost.sourceforge.net/support.html</P>
