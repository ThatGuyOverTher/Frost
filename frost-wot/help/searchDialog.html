<H2>Search dialog</H2>

<P>This help page describes the not-so-intuitional fields of the search messages dialog.</P>

<P><B>Sender, Subject and Content text field</B></P>

<P>The values in these fields must be separated by blanks. Each phrase that is given must occur in the appropriate field of the message.
So if you enter '<CODE>emil waltraud</CODE>' in the content field, all messages containing both of these words in its content text are found.</P>

<P>If a text field is left blank, messages are not checked for content of these field. If you want to find <I>all</I> messages, leave all text fields blank. Because if you would enter an asterisk ('*') in the content text field, messages containing this character would be found only.</P>

<P><B>NOTE:</B> If messages flagged as NEW are found and you open them, the NEW state will <B>NOT</B> be resetted.</P>
