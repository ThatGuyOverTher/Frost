This is just a collection of hints, some are useful, others not...

##############
# Searching: #
##############

Display all files Frost knows about: *

Searching for files with a maximum age: *age[number of days]

Examples:
Search todays files: '*age'
Search files from the last 3 days: '*age3'

Of course you can combine *age with your normal request, for example: '*age2 metallica one'

It is also possible to exclude search results with '*-'.

Examples: 
Exclude filenames containing the word porn: '*-porn'
Multiple words can be excluded, for example: '*-porn;sex'

And of course this can be combined with other requests also, for example:
'*age3 *-porn;sex metallica one'

The order of these commands does not matter.


It is also possible to search through all boards. Just activate the most right switch in the search tab (it is activated by default).

Some FAQ's... (the old faq.txt file)

Q: How do I add new boards?
A: Select folder that should contain the new board. Right click on the tree structure. Select 'Add new board / folder'. Rename 'New folder' by selecting it and pressing F2 or double klick it. You can also press the 'Add board' icon in the icon bar.

Q: Are there any special search options?
A: Yes, I'll just give some examples.
   - Search for todays new files: *age
   - Search for all mp3 files from the last 5 days: .mp3 *age5
   - Just show all files: *
   - Don't display pictures jpg, gif and bmp pictures: *-.jpg;.gif;.bmp	

Q: Why Frost?
A: Why not?

Q: Cut and Paste does not work in Linux
A: Try using CTRL+C (COpy), CTRL+V (Paste) and CTRL+X (Cut)

Q: How can I change the "LookAndFeel" settings
A: There's a command line setting. Get more info with frost -? (from the command line)

Q: Can I shut down Frost after uploading my files?
A: Yes

Q: Why is everything so slow?
A: Because Freenet is so slow, and Frost is a Freenet client. Uploads will probably get faster with more Freenet users.

Q: I don't like the way replies are handled in Frost. Can you use ">" to indent old text?
A: Hehe, no way.

Q: What Datastore size should I use for my Freenet Node?
A: The larger the better. At least the size of the largest file you want to download. For example if you want to download large movies, 1Gb is a good size. 

Q: My upload was aborted because... (fill in your story here). Do I have to upload everything again?
A: No, if you restart the upload you'll probably see that it progresses much faster. Only parts of the file that have not been uploaded yet will be uploaded. (This is not true for files with a size below 256Kb, because they are not split into smaller parts)

Q: My download stopped because of... (yeah, another story...). Do I have to download everything again?
A: No, Frost stores already downloaded chunks in the 'keypool' directory. 

Q: Chunks?
A: Large files are split up into several chunks, each with a size of 256Kb. These 'Splitfiles' can be downloaded from multiple sources at once.

Q: I can't get a specific file, but I really need it!
A: Go to options / downloads. Set maximum htl to 2500 and splitfile threads to 5. It will take several hours, but if the file is still available on Freenet you'll get it.

Q: The attachments of messages appear in the public keyindex!
A: Yes, they do. If you want only a specific person to see your attachments, please use PGP to encrypt the files.
