<PRE>

<h3>Future</h3>

<b>Most important changes in no particular order:</b>
<ul>
<li>All messages (NOT files) are uploaded now with the EarlyEncode FCP option set to true by default. 
This allows Frost to detect data collisions 6 times faster than before. In any case, that behavior can 
be controlled using the new fcp2.useEarlyEncode entry in the settings file. Thanks to Sadao for the patch.

	</li>
	<li>Corrections for readme.en.txt, provided by: Convict ? 19682?@ODNPfyzW6zsBykdOYM_SItF+oDo</li>
	<li>On a replay to a message, all attached files and boards are now quoted as text in 
the quoted message so they wont be lost to users reading later follow-ups. (Based on the idea of an anonymous user)</li>
	<li>Added function to prefix the filename of inserts in the AddNewUploadsDialog.</li>
	<li>Bugfix for error when systray is not supported.</li>
	<li>Fix for file sharing system: when the option is turned on (default) we drop file lists from 
newly received identities or identities marked CHECK or BAD. Then only file lists from GOOD and OBSERVE people make 
it into our file list store, and this prevents huge store files full of senseless faked files due to the spam attack.</li>
	<li>Made increaseDownloadItemRuntime resistance against time drifts due heavy load.</li>
	<li>Fixed bug, where the configured priority of a new download was not honored, but	always set to the default.</li>
	<li>Show text field with a readable yellow background instead of a red background.</li>
	<li>Added ability to enable / disable downloads before adding them to the queue. Via clickable checkboxes and 
context menu items</li>
	<li>Added context menu items to AddNewUploadsDialog, to remove selected / not selected entries.</li>
	<li>Added the ability to disable uploads before adding them to the queue</li>
	<li>Redesigned columns for enabling and disabling compression and the downloads to use click able check boxes.</li>
	<li>Added the ability to upload a file under a different name</li>
	<li>Added the ability to set the start priority before adding it to the download queue</li>
	<li>Extended FrostUploadItem to be configurable with a FreenetCompatibilityMode</li>
	<li>Added context menu to AddNewUploadsDialog:<ul>
			<li>Added context menu items to enable and disable compression</li>
			<li>Added context menu items to set FreenetInsertMode for uploads. Note: This is front-end only. The 
mode is not honor by the back-end mode yet.</li>
   	</ul></li>
	<li>Added ability to add and remove files from the AddNewUploadsDialog</li>
	<li>Created AddNewUploadsDialog</li>
	<li>Added fix requested by a Frost user: allow user to suppress initial warning window when filesharing is enabled.</li>
	<li>Fix for NPE when sending a message. Happens only when persistence is switched off.</li>
	<li>Implemented support for the TestDDA node request. This re-enables the DDA support in Frost that did not work 
since the node made TestDDA mandatory. This commit intentionally breaks the GUI feature to change the download target 
directory AFTER a download was started! We will need to address this issue somehow later.</li>
	<li>Re-enabled the "always minimize to systray"	functionality.</li>
	<li>Fix for NPE within systray support.</li>
</ul>
