##### checkpoint: alpha #####
(ship to customers if done)

- implement new filesharing in gui and backend
- resolve _ALL_ FIXME comments in source
- implement merge of imported identities
- optimize identities in database, shorten the load time in identities browser

##### realease #####

- fixes if neccessary, maybe release another alpha/beta/RC

##### checkpoint: release +1 #####

- implement FcpJob,FcpJobDispatcher,... (dependences to Hyperocha!)
- implement tabbed panel with status informations taken from FcpJobDispatcher and FcpJob
- together with FcpJobs integrate the Hyperocha library

##### checkpoint: release +2 #####

- implement message format V2 (redundancy)

##### checkpoint: any (if we know how to implement) #####

? outbox folder for messages (show messages until they are successfully sent)
? drafts folder for messages
? own folder for all private messages (but don't use a single board because this is
                                       a single point of failure if spammed!)

Old, but still interesting TODOS
---------------------------------

***** 2003/09/10 - zab
- Implement statistic keeping and some smarter polling algorithm (SVMs?)
- Redundancy? - V2

***** 2003/07/21 - zab

- Make it look more like netscape mail/outlook :
  * Make icons bigger (4x size roughly) and with text on them
    (this means different icons for localisations, eventually)
  * Move attach board/file & flag GOOD/BAD to a new toolbar
    that appears only when the message is signed/with attachment
  * Instead of "Refresh board/folder" say "Get new messages" everywhere
- Move the @digest part of the nickname in its own column
- Possibly allow rich text or some limited markup of messages
