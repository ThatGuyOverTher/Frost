- Decide whether choosing to help someone's files should mark them GOOD. 
  also rework the serialization of those lists, its not well structured now
- Implement statistic keeping and some smarter polling algorithm (SVMs?)
- Redundancy?

- Make it look more like netscape mail/outlook :
  * Make icons bigger (4x size roughly) and with text on them
    (this means different icons for localisations, eventually)
  * Move attach board/file & flag GOOD/BAD to a new toolbar
    that appears only when the message is signed/with attachment
  * Instead of "Refresh board/folder" say "Get new messages" everywhere
- Move the @digest part of the nickname in its own column
- Possibly allow rich text or some limited markup of messages
