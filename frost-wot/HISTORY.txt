Changes since version 28-May-2004 dev:

Added:  a title to the "Enabled" column of the downloads table.
Added:  country flags to the language menu.
Added:  now the user can choose which columns the search, download and upload tables should show. That
		selection is made via a contextual menu that pops up when right clicking on the table header.
Added:  French translation vastly updated (thanks to RapHHfr).
Added:  Message upload failed dialog internationalized.
Added:  Option added to the preferences to disable the message upload failed dialog. If disabled, Frost 
		will retry to send it without asking the user.

Changed: splash screen logo replaced by a new one (thanks to Frédéric Scheer).
Changed: when you are sending an anonymous message, the @ character is no longer allowed as part of the 
		 from field.

Bugfix: when the text in the "Name" column of the uploads table is written in bold and it doesn't fit
		in the cell it isn't cropped correctly. Fixed now (it no longer uses HTML internally to display 
		it in bold).
Bugfix: The message upload failed dialog works now. Some strings were missing from the language resource.
		(thanks to SSY)
Bugfix: From Freenet 5099 on, keywords may be longer than 64 characters. Thanks to mxbee for reporting it.
Bugfix: The HopsToLive parameter must be in hexadecimal. Thanks to mxbee.
Bugfix: With Java 1.5, the attachment split panes of the main frame were not working well.
