  - uses java classes, not freenet node
  - native encoding plugins supported (same as for freenet)
  - stores temp files in data,checkblocks sand redirect file, not longer 1 file for each block
  - reliable handling of uploads and downloads
! to insert a file directly, add it to upload table, right click it and choose 'Reload'
  you can also encode a newly added file on demand (see popup menu) to prepare it for upload,
  but file will also be encoded if you choose to reload (upload) it or if file is requested  --bback
- fixed bug within reloading of saved upload items  --bback
+ added check for JAR files on startup of frost  --bback
